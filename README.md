## Description:
Java application for the user to make appointments for predetermined courses with set times and dates.

Written and collaborated by Zhanhang Xiao (https://github.com/Saunorine) and Fermin Garduno (https://github.com/FerminGarduno).

### Purpose:
A program that could schedule workout courses for a local gym. Add courses that could be written as a class with a course name, trainer name, date, time, intensity, and courseSize. Then user could use the interface to navigate courses and sort through them. Their information they logged in with would be then be added to the course member list for the staff to look at.

## Requirements:
1. A GUI that the gym member uses to login and select courses to sign up for
2. Can sort available appointments by price/trainer etc
3. Add new staff appointments
4. Return errors if needed

### Learning Outcome Requirements
  * Design principles of object-oriented programming ✓ - Created 2 objects that will work together to create the program
  * Single and multidimensional arrays ✓ - ArrayLists for Course and Accounts
  * Uses objects and classes in object ✓
  * Inheritance and polymorphism, including abstract classes and interfaces - STILL NEED THIS
  * Generic collections and data structures ✓ - Using ArrayLists to hold objects of Courses for an Account object
  * GUI utilizing event-driven programming ✓
  * Construct programs utilizing exception handling ✓
  * Text File I/O ✓

### Ideas:
  * see if we can somehow integrate google calendar
  * reschedule appointments after being made
  * send email notifying about the appointment after booking
  * GUI will be different depending on user or staff login

### Weekly Updates
## Week 1:
Do CRC cards for the project

List requirements

Look for ways to implements learning outcomes

Plan out the inner workings

## Week 2:
write course class, account/user info class, test cases

## Week 3:
Finish up writing the classes and junit tests.

## Week 4: 
Write up JUnit Tests and polish up classes. Look over Accounts and staffAccounts class and see how else we can implement polymorphism. 

## Week 5:
Zhanhang is going to work on the GUI assignment and try to get the first 2-3 pages done with buttons that takes the user between each one. Fermin should write up the sorting methods for sorting courses by time/date/alphabetical etc. Continue looking for ways to implement learning outcomes.

## Week 6:
Need to finish up the rest of the project and add the other windows: course creation screen and some other ones.

Need to add interfaces and other learning outcomes. File I/O for storing account info? just need something to work.

## Week 7
Got File I/O done, account/course/enrollment info is stored in text files and program saves to it when it closes and reads it when it opens back up.

still no interfaces

still need other stuff too
